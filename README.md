# Sitche-CMD
This is a command line version of a chess engine I started developing in the spring of 2019. Only being able to search one move ahead at first, this engine has gone through a few major upgrades. This engine can analyze millions of positions using multiple threads to make a move. The original version had a GUI rendered with LibGDX, but this command line verson is more cloning friendly.

After learning a lot about playing chess in the fall of 2018, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oXyibEgJr0">this</a> on the general approach to programming a turn-based game engine and decided to try and implement it myself.

Instructions on how to use it are given when it is run.
