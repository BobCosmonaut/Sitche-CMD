# Sitche-CMD
This is a command line version of a chess engine I started developing in the spring of 2019. Only being able to search one move ahead at first, this engine has gone through a few major upgrades. This engine can analyze millions of positions using multiple threads to make a move. The original version is rendered with LibGDX, a framework that is not made for what I was using it for and cloning would be cumbersome, so I created this version.
