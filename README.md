# Sitche-CMD
This is a command line version of a chess engine I started developing in the spring of 2019. Only being able to search one move ahead at first, this engine has gone through a few major upgrades. This engine can analyze millions of positions using multiple threads to make a move. The original version had a GUI rendered with LibGDX, a framework that is not made for what I was using it for and cloning would be cumbersome, so I created this version.

After learning a lot about playing chess in the fall of 2018, I watched a video explaining the general approach to programming a chess engine and decided to try and implement it myself. All of the code is my own.

Instructions on how to use it are given when it is run.
